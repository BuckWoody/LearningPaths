# Learning Path - Customer Churn Prediction using Vienna

## Audience: Data Scientist, Developer
## Type: Solution

### Summary
The aim of this solution is to demonstrate predictive churn analytics using Vienna. This solution provides an easy to use template to develop churn predictive data pipelines for retailers. The template can be used with different datasets and different definitions of churn. Retailers can avoid customer churn by using these predictions combined with proper marketing strategies.
