# Learning Path - Interactive Voice Response Bot

## Audience: Developer

## Type: Technical

### Summary
Automated customer interaction is essential to a business of any size. In fact, 61% of consumers prefer to communicate via speech, and most of them prefer self-service. Because customer satisfaction is a priority for all businesses, self-service is a critical facet of any customer-facing communications strategy.

In an era when mobile phones are dominant and keypads are not always readily accessible, interactive voice response (IVR) systems provide an intuitive, simple, and convenient method for customers to convey their requests.

#### Concepts

1. Bot Framework
2. Cognitive Services
3. Language Understanding
4. Voice Integration
