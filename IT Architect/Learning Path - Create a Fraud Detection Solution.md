Learning Path - Create a Fraud Detection Solution with Microsoft Business Analytics and AI
=================================================================================
Audience: IT Architect
---------------------------------
Type: Solution
--------------------
### Summary
In this learning path, you'll learn how to use the Team Data Science Process and the Microsoft Business Analytics and AI Platform to create fraud detecting solution. Building upon your foundation in the Microsoft Business Analytics and AI Platform, you'll learn about fraud detection and its use cases, as well as how to implement a detection solution effectively. You'll be guided through articles, demo videos, tutorials, and solutions from the [Cortana Intelligence Gallery](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/).
