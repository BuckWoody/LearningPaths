Learning Path - Create an Anomaly Detection Solution with CIS
=================================================================================
Audience: IT Architect, Data Scientist
---------------------------------
Type: Solution
--------------------
### Summary
In this learning path, you'll learn how to use the Team Data Science Process and the Cortana Intelligence Suite Platform to create anomaly detection solutions for a variety of applications. Building upon your foundation in the Cortana Intelligence Suite Platform, you'll learn about anomaly detection and its use cases, as well as how to implement an anomaly detection solution effectively. You'll be guided through articles, demo videos, tutorials, and solutions from the [Cortana Intelligence Gallery](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/).
